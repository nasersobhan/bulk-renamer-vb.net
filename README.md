# bulk-renamer-vb.net
A little app to help you clean file name to use theme in your loops of programming.
once I developed an application in php which was checking a folder for files and folder and shows them in a website (to be accessible public), and people updates that folder everyday but I faced an issues when were people uploading files and folders with special chars like (this is #2 (data).file) so i needed to change # () and maybe space to avoid problem in php. than I have developed a small tool to rename the files to something better.  itâ€™s in vb.net and source is attached too.

enjoy it.
